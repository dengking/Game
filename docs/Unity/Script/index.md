### [Scripts as Behaviour Components](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/scripts-as-behaviour-components?uv=2019.3&projectId=5c8920b4edbc2a113b6bc26a#)

What are Scripts in Unity? Learn about the behavior component that is a Unity script, and how to Create and Attach them to objects.

> NOTE: unity中的component是能够"apply to object"的，既然script是behavior component，那么它就是可以apply to object的，unity还有哪些component？
